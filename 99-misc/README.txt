# misc

This folder contains **various small experiments, scripts, and practice snippets in Java** that don’t belong to a single structured project.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of this folder is to:
- Experiment with different Java concepts  
- Test ideas quickly before building full projects  
- Practice syntax and problem-solving  
- Keep useful code snippets in one place  

## 🧠 What you can find here  

Examples of contents in this folder may include:

- Small Java programs  
- Algorithm practice  
- Data structure experiments  
- Streams API tests  
- OOP mini examples  
- Quick console utilities  
- Code snippets for learning and reference  

Each file is usually **standalone** and runnable on its own.

## ▶️ How to run  

1. Open the file in **IntelliJ IDEA**  
2. Run the `main` method in the selected class  

or from terminal:

```

javac FileName.java
java FileName

```

## 📌 Notes  
This is not a structured project — it is a **playground for learning and testing Java ideas**.
