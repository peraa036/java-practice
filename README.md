- Improve problem-solving skills in Java  
- Build a foundation for Spring Boot development

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Java 17+**
- OOP (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)
- Collections Framework (List, Set, Map)
- Streams API  
- Exceptions Handling  
- Basic SQL & JDBC (in some examples)
- IntelliJ IDEA  
- Git & GitHub  

## 📂 What’s inside  

The repository includes examples such as:

- Basic Java programs  
- OOP mini projects  
- Collections practice  
- Streams API exercises  
- Simple console applications  
- JDBC examples  

(Actual folders will be added as the repository grows.)
